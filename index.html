		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>The Rhythm Thief Fan Sequel is a passion project that is being made by fans for fans! Raphael's adventure, which ended in quite the cliffhanger, made players anxious for a sequel that never arrived. We are trying to continue Raphael's story.</p><p>This all started with a comment on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je1nL5y2qUg">a YouTube video</a> made by the current project manager, Kopi Mopi.</p>

Nevertheless, a month later, Raphael reads a newspaper article about an art theft that wasn't his. The police seem to think it was though.</p><p>The Phantom R needs to clear his name and get to the bottom of this! </p>
